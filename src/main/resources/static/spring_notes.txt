NOTES:

1. Package Persistence

import javax.persistence.*;

Package is part of the Java Persistence API (JPA), which is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database.

Examples include @Entity, @Table, @Column, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc.

2. Annotations

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

Package in Spring Framework provides annotations that are used to build Spring MVC web applications.

a. @RestController: Similar to @Controller, but it also adds @ResponseBody to the methods by default, which means the return values are automatically serialized into JSON or XML and written to the HTTP response body.

b. @RequestBody: Body->raw->JSON
